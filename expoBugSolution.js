The provided code in expoBug.js doesn't directly cause the described issue, as the problem is intermittent and not tied to any specific code snippet. The solution focuses on addressing potential underlying system issues. 

**Steps to improve stability:**

1. **Check System Resources:** Monitor your computer's CPU and memory usage while running the Expo development server. If resources are close to maxing out, this could lead to crashes. Close unnecessary applications to free up resources.
2. **Upgrade Expo CLI:** Run `expo upgrade` to update to the latest version. New versions often include bug fixes and performance improvements that might resolve the issue.
3. **Check for Conflicting Processes:**  Identify any other processes that might be contending for resources or interfering with the Expo development server. Temporarily disable or close potentially conflicting software.
4. **Clean Expo Cache:** Run `expo prebuild --clean` to clear any potentially corrupted cache that may be contributing to the crashes.  Then, rebuild the app using `expo start`.
5. **Check your dependencies:** Review your package.json file for any outdated or conflicting dependencies. Update or remove problematic libraries.
6. **Restart your computer:** Sometimes a simple system restart can resolve unexpected issues.
7. **Reinstall Node and npm:** As a last resort, consider reinstalling Node.js and npm to ensure a fresh setup.  Make sure you have the latest Node version for better compatibility with Expo.

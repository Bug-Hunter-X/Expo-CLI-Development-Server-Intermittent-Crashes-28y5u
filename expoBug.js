While using Expo CLI, I encountered an error where the development server would unexpectedly crash without providing any clear error messages in the console.  The app would build and run fine on the simulator, but when making changes, the server would simply stop responding.  Restarting the server and the machine didn't consistently solve the problem. The issue was intermittent and made development difficult.
